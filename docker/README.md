# Docker images for Texar

## Build the docker image

If you don't have Docker, please [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) first.

This Dockerfile is supplied to build docker image with Ubuntu 16.04, cuda 10.0 and cudnn v7. The image uses Miniconda to configure python environment.

The image need to be built from `texar` repo directory, because docker needs to copy `texar` repo into its filesystem to install Texar into the image. So under current directory, run the following cmds to build image:

```bash
cd .. 
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t texar .
```

The Miniconda uses python3.6 by default, but you can pass `--build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=x.y` flag in the building cmd to specify the python version for Miniconda. E.g. under `texar` repo directory, run following cmds to build image with python2.7:

```bash
docker build --build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=2.7 -f docker/Dockerfile  -t texar  . 
```

Otherwise leave it unset to use the default python3.6

## Check Texar installation

To check if Texar is installed correctly, firstly run container shell from the image, use following cmd:

```bash
docker run -it texar /bin/bash
```

Then import Texar in python, we can run the following cmd into container shell:

```bash
python -c "import texar as tx;print(tx.data)"
```

If Texar is installed correctly, the shell should return:

```bash
<module 'texar.data' from '/opt/texar/texar/data/__init__.py'>
```

To exit the container shell, press `Ctrl` + `d`.
